# 🐧 Bash Scripting Bootcamp: 10 Practical Projects

This repository documents my journey through a **Project-Based Bash Scripting Bootcamp**. It contains 10 hands-on scripts designed to solve real-world system administration and automation challenges using Linux Shell.

## 🚀 Overview

These projects demonstrate a progression from basic shell interaction to advanced system monitoring and automation. Each script focuses on core DevOps skills such as:

- **System Administration:** Package management and user privilege checks.
- **Automation:** Batch processing images and logging data.
- **Monitoring:** Server health checks and real-time clocks.
- **Scripting Concepts:** Loops, Arrays, Conditional Logic, I/O Redirection, and Colorized Output.

## 📂 Project List

| # | Project Name | Description | Key Concepts |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | **Random Quote Generator** | A script that displays a motivational or random quote upon execution. | Arrays, Randomization ($RANDOM) |
| 02 | **Password Generator** | Generates secure, random passwords for user accounts. | String Manipulation, Hashing |
| 03 | **Digital Clock** | A real-time digital clock displayed directly in the terminal. | `while` loops, `sleep`, `date` command |
| 04 | **System Maintenance** | Automates system updates, upgrades, and cleanup of unused packages. | `apt` package manager, chaining commands |
| 05 | **Root User Checker** | A utility to verify if the current user has root privileges before running sensitive tasks. | Conditional Logic (`if-else`), UID checks |
| 06 | **Bulk Package Installer** | A robust script to install multiple software packages via a loop, featuring colorized output and error handling. | Arrays, `for` loops, ANSI Colors, Error Handling |
| 07 | **Batch Image Processor** | Automates the processing (renaming/converting) of image files in a directory. | File globbing, String substitution |
| 08 | **File Inspector** | Analyzes a specific file and provides detailed metadata (size, type, permissions). | File test operators, `stat` command |
| 09 | **Employee Data Logger** | An interactive script that captures user input and saves it to a CSV format for record-keeping. | `read` input, I/O Redirection (`>>`) |
| 10 | **Server Health Monitor** | A dashboard script that reports CPU load, memory usage, and disk space utilization. | `top`, `free`, `df`, `awk` |
